### CPSC 120

* Lab 7
    Lab 7, part 2 was a pivotal part of the course. In this section, we take a previous program, and begin to establish functions for specific repetitive tasks. This lab showed us the importance of compartmentalizing code by creating functions. Once we finished creating all the functions, writing the main function read more like English than code which was impressive to see.

* Lab 8
    Lab 8, part 3 was one lab section that I really found interesting. It was cool to see how ASII animations are implemented. I know that there are several movies/animations/games that run using ascii-animations like the entire star wars film through telnet. Although we did not create our own animations (which would have been extremely tedious I assume), we got exposed to the workings of animations sufficiently to explore further at our own will.

* Lab 10
    Lab 10, part 2 was another interesting lab. In that lab, we were given a large file containing data regarding several counties. We were tasked with retrieving information about a specific county. However, from here it is clear to see that we could have easily done several other operations given more data. For example, we could track the population of a county over time or even how the population demographic morphs over time. This lab introduced us to the inner workings of databases and how they are implemented.
